# Introduction to Scandroid

!!! info "At a glance"
    **Scandroid** is a lightweight, offline-ready app built by the **510 team at the Netherlands Red Cross**.  
    It extends the **121 Platform** to help validate people in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) programmes,  
    especially where formal ID or smartphones are not available.

The concept is simple:

- **Red Cross staff** register people in the programme and provide each with a printed **QR code**.  
- Staff configure the system, choosing which key details appear when scanned by Financial Service Providers (FSPs) â€” for example: photo, date of birth, and home village.  
- **FSPs** scan the QR code, check these details with the person, and then **approve or reject** the payment.  

Because Scandroid is designed for **offline use**, FSPs can:

- **Sync once** to download the latest beneficiary data.  
- Validate payments **offline** by scanning QR codes.  
- **Push all approvals/rejections back to the 121 Platform** when back online.  

Scandroid is:

- **Lightweight and easy to use** for FSPs in the field.  
- **Flexible and customisable** for Red Cross staff configuring validation.  
- **Accessible**, with multiple languages supported out of the box.
