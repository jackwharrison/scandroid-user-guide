# Introduction to Scandroid

**Scandroid** is a lightweight mobile and web application developed by the **510 team at the Netherlands Red Cross**. It extends the **121 Platform** to support **offline validation** in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) programmes, particularly in contexts where people may not have formal identification or access to smartphones.

The concept is simple:

- **Red Cross staff** register people in the programme and provide each with a printed **QR code**.  
- Staff also configure the system, selecting which key details are shown to Financial Service Providers (FSPs) during validation (for example: photo, date of birth, and home village).  
- When an **FSP scans the QR code**, these details appear. The FSP then asks the person simple security questions. If the details match, the payment can be **approved**; if not, it can be **rejected**.  

Because Scandroid is designed for **offline use**, FSPs can:

- **Sync once** to download the most up-to-date beneficiary data.  
- Continue scanning and approving/rejecting payments even without an internet connection.  
- **Push all decisions back to the 121 Platform** as soon as they reconnect online.  

Scandroid is built to be:

- **Lightweight and easy to use** for FSPs in the field.  
- **Flexible and customisable** for Red Cross staff configuring the validation process.  
- **Accessible**, with multiple languages available out of the box.
