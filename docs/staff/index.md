# Welcome to Scandroid

Scandroid is a practical, user-friendly tool developed by 510, the data initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross. It was designed to support cash-based assistance in remote or low-connectivity environments — making it easier for both Red Cross staff and financial service providers (FSPs) to serve communities more efficiently.

At its core, Scandroid allows staff and vendors to scan QR codes linked to beneficiaries. With just a quick scan, you can view key information such as names, ID numbers, entitlements, and payment status — even when offline. Once internet is available, all changes sync securely in the background.

This system has been used in the field by branch staff, volunteers, and FSP partners to manage cash distributions smoothly, reduce paperwork, and improve accuracy in humanitarian operations.

Whether you’re verifying a beneficiary, approving a payment, or managing system settings, this guide is your starting point. Use the menu on the left to navigate to the section most relevant to you — FSPs, Red Cross staff, or administrators.

If you need help at any point, just refer to the contact information in the footer below. We're here to support you.
